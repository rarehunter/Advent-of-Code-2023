# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my work for Advent of Code 2023. Advent of Code is an online event of 25 programming puzzles that helps people hone their problem-solving skills. There are 25 problems, each containing two parts (except for Day 25 which only contains one part).

All the code is written in Java.

Each Java file contains some initial logic for reading and parsing the input into appropriate data structures and then executes the algorithms to solve both parts of the problem. The method `part1` solves part 1 of the problem and the method `part2` solves part 2 of the problem.

Problem descriptions can be found here:

My approaches and overall thought process to each of this season's problems are documented in the source code. Future improvements are called out as well.

Here are some concepts/data structures that were learned or exercised this year:
- String manipulation
- Dictionary (associative arrays, mapping)
- 2-dimensional arrays

_Note: The input files themselves are not uploaded here as they are not licensed for reproduction or distribution._
